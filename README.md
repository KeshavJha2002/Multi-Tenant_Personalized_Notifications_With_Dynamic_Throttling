# Multi-Tenant, Personalized Notifications with Dynamic Throttling

## Scenario:

You are tasked with extending your scalable notification system to support a multi-tenant e-commerce platform. This platform serves multiple online stores, each with its own customer base. Your notification system must handle personalized notifications for various events like order confirmations, shipping updates, promotional offers, and account alerts.

### Requirements:

#### 1) **Multi-Tenant Support:**

- The system must distinguish between different tenants (online stores). Each tenant should have its own Kafka topics and queues to ensure isolation of data and operations.
- Tenants should be able to configure their notification preferences, including which types of notifications to send, priority levels, and preferred channels (email, SMS, push notifications).

#### 2) **Personalization:**

- Notifications must be personalized based on customer data (e.g., name, order details, past purchase behavior). The system should retrieve this data dynamically from a central customer database or an external API.
- Implement a template engine that allows tenants to customize the content of notifications using placeholders (e.g., "{{customer_name}}").

#### 3) **Event-Driven Architecture:**

- Notifications should be triggered by a wide variety of events, such as order placement, shipping status changes, customer sign-up, and abandoned cart reminders. Events will be generated by different microservices within the e-commerce platform.
- Some events (e.g., promotional campaigns) may trigger bulk notifications to a large number of customers simultaneously, requiring efficient handling of high throughput.

#### 4) **Dynamic Throttling and Rate Limiting:**

- Implement dynamic throttling based on tenant preferences and system load. For example, one tenant might require a maximum of 100 SMS messages per minute, while another might have no such restriction.
- The system should be able to adjust rate limits dynamically based on factors like time of day, tenant-specific agreements, or unexpected spikes in traffic (e.g., during a flash sale).

#### 5) **Priority Handling:**

- Notifications must be prioritized based on the type of event. For example, account alerts should have higher priority than promotional offers.
- Implement a priority queue system where urgent notifications are processed and delivered first, without causing significant delays to lower-priority messages.

#### 6) **Failure Handling and Retry Logic:**

- Implement robust error handling and retry logic. For example, if an SMS gateway is temporarily unavailable, the system should retry sending the SMS after a delay, without blocking other notifications.
- Failed notifications should be logged and moved to a dead-letter queue for further investigation and manual intervention if necessary.

#### 7) **Logging and Monitoring:**

- The system must log all actions, including message production, consumption, delivery, and failures. Logs should be tenant-specific to enable easier debugging and analysis.
- Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for key metrics such as message throughput, queue length, failure rates, and notification delivery times.

#### 8) **Scalability and Performance:**

- The system should be capable of scaling horizontally to handle an increasing number of tenants and customers. Kafka partitions and consumer groups should be designed to ensure even load distribution.
- Performance should be tested under various scenarios, such as sending millions of notifications during a major sales event, to ensure that the system can maintain low latency and high throughput.

#### 9) **Tenant-Specific Reporting:**

- Implement a reporting module that allows each tenant to view detailed statistics about their notifications, such as the number of messages sent, delivery success rates, and customer engagement metrics (e.g., email open rates).
- Reports should be generated periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) and should be customizable by the tenant.

#### 10) **Compliance and Data Privacy:**

- Ensure that the system complies with data privacy regulations like GDPR. For example, customer data should be anonymized or encrypted as necessary, and tenants should be able to manage customer consent for receiving notifications.
- Implement audit logging to track access to customer data and ensure that only authorized users and services can access or modify this data.

## Objective:

Your task is to design, implement, and deploy this extended notification system while ensuring that it meets all of the above requirements. Focus on making the system robust, scalable, and flexible enough to accommodate the diverse needs of multiple tenants. The final implementation should be fully dockerized and include comprehensive test cases and benchmarks to validate its performance under different conditions.

## Benchmarks and Goals

#### 1) **Throughput:**

- **Low load:** 5,000 notifications/second with minimal resource usage.
- **Medium load:** 20,000 notifications/second with < 50ms latency.
- **High load:** 50,000 notifications/second with < 100ms latency.

#### 2) **Latency:**

- **Email:** < 300ms avg, 95% within 500ms.
- **SMS:** < 150ms avg, 95% within 300ms.
- **In-App:** < 50ms avg, 99% within 100ms.

#### 3) **Scalability:** 

- **Linear Scalability:** Doubling the number of Kafka partitions and consumer instances should result in a proportional increase in throughput, with no significant increase in latency.
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU and memory usage should remain efficient even as the system scales. Ideally, resource usage should increase linearly with the load.

#### 4) **Fault Tolerance:**

- **Failure Recovery:** System should recover from a Kafka broker failure within 10 seconds, with minimal message loss (<0.1%) and automatic rebalancing of consumer groups.
- **Retry Handling:** Notifications that fail to send should be retried within 5 seconds, with a 99% success rate after the first retry.
- **Dead-Letter Queue:** Less than 0.01% of messages should end up in the dead-letter queue during normal operations.

#### 5) **Rate Limiting Efficiency:**

- **Rate Compliance:** 99% compliance with configured rate limits (e.g., 100 SMS/minute) across all tenants and notification types.
- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Rate limits should dynamically adjust within 1 second of detecting a load spike, with no significant drop in throughput or increase in latency.

#### 6) **Resource Utilization:**

- **CPU Utilization:** Less than 50% CPU usage under medium load, with peaks not exceeding 70% under high load.
- **Memory Usage:** Memory usage should remain below 60% of total available RAM under medium load, with peaks not exceeding 75% under high load.
- **Network Bandwidth:** Efficient use of network bandwidth, with minimal overhead from message serialization/deserialization and transport.

#### 7) **Logging and Monitoring Overhead:**

- **Logging Overhead:** Logging should add less than 5 ms to the overall latency for each notification.
- **Monitoring Impact:** The monitoring system should consume less than 10% of total resources (CPU, memory) and should not significantly affect the throughput or latency.

#### 8) **Bulk Operations:**

- **Bulk Throughput:** Ability to handle bulk operations (e.g., 1 million notifications) with minimal degradation in throughput and latency. The target processing time for bulk operations should be less than 10 minutes.
- **Bulk Latency:** Average latency during bulk operations should remain below 200 ms.

#### 9) **Security and Data Privacy Compliance:**

- **Encryption Overhead:** Encryption and decryption of messages should add less than 10 ms to the overall processing time.
- **Access Control:** Implementing access control checks should add less than 5 ms per operation, with negligible impact on throughput.
